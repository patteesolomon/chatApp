// THIS IS TIME COMPLEXITY
/*
 * 
 * a basic for loop would be O(1) in spacial complexity
 * the amount of iterations would be operations and function
 * calls. The more operations and calls there are in the
 * loop they will add to the n in the O(n) constant
 * 
 * If we have more functions or operations 
 * outside of the loop
 * you would need to add the two.
 * 
 * eg: y = 1 +9; // A non for loop basic algebra
 * for (...)
 * {// basically 3 ops} // B C D
 * 
 *  A+n + n(b + c +d)
 * 
 * => ksub1 + nksub2 
 * 
 *  the answer would O(n)
 *  
 * 
 *  heres a table O
